### TODO

[x] Initialize the Editor State with a FlexLayoutNode. The LexicalComposer Component will append a ParagraphNode to the Root Node if the Root Node is empty.(see LexicalComposer.dev.js @ Line 92) We want Paragraph Nodes to always be children of FlexLayoutNodes to fit our layout model.

[x] Update ImageNode insertion logic to insert image nodes as siblings of the target paragraph

[] Add logic to handle ENTER press when the selection is at the beginning of in the middle of text
